\subsection*{Problem 3.1}
Answer Problem 3.1 here. The definition of the quaternion error is written as:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{q}} = \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\eta} \\ \tilde{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}} \end{bmatrix} =\overline{\mathbf{q}_d} \otimes \mathbf{q}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Problem 3.2}
Answer Problem 3.2 here. If you want to make a reference to the book, you can do that with the cite command: \cite{Fossen2011}. The data for the references must be created in the "bibliography.bib" file. The other references in the assignment are also stored in the bibliography. Cite them as \cite{Chateurverdi} and \cite{Fjellstad1994857}. Note that you need to install BibTeX to compile the bibliography.
